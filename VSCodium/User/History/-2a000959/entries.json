The Arch Logo button should have an actual button appearance with the button background using the accent color and the arch logo should match the bar background color.\n\n2. The clock is not centered on the bar.\n\n3. The power button should also appear as a button using an accent color from the thtme color palette. Themes are located in ~/.config/hypr/themes/ and the script that sets the theme is ~/.config/hypr/theme-switcher.conf.\n\n4. The workspace numbers should be the size font used by the clock, and vice versa. The updater on the right side of the bar should also use the same size font as the clock.\n\nDoes the new quickshell bar use the color themes that my waybar setup uses? If not, it should be implemented.\n\n'","timestamp":1760462195230}]}
