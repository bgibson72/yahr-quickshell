Can we have the thumbnail be the size it is after the image is selected as shown in the screenshot, and instead of the icon button for the image upload, use a text label that says Select An Image. \n\nI'm also not clear what the \"play\" button does below where it says Extracted 7 colors...The button seems unnecessary, so let's remove it.\n\nThe app is also only puling 7 colors from the images, instead of the selected 8.
