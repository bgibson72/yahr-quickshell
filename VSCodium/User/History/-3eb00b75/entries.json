The search function can be removed because it doesn't work anyway.\n\nThe calendar would spring open right under the date and time in the bar, and the power menu can spring open from under the power button. Change the power menu layout to be a single column.\n\nIf available, I would also like to assign each of these widgets a key bind:\n\nApp launcher - $mainMod, A, exec, $menu\nCalendar - $mainMod, C, exec, $calendar\nPower menu - $mainMod, ESC, exec, $powermenu\n\nThe variables above exist under MY PROGRAMS in hyprland.conf, but need to be assigned to whatever command is used to call these widgets.\n\nCaelestia Shell uses this effect when opening some of it's bar widgets, so I know this is possible. Refer to the Caelestia Shell directory if needed.\n'","timestamp":1761054232305}]}
