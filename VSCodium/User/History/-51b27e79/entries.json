The icon button in the status bar is also tied to a keybind that uses a script at ~/.config/quickshell/toggle-theme-switcher, and there is also a wallpaper picker widget that has a similar keybind using a script in the same location called toggle-wallpaper-picker. \n\nSo I will need a toggle-app-launcher, toggle-calendar and toggle-power-menu helper script to do the same, and the hyprland.conf file needs to be updated to bind these helper scripts to their respective keybinds which are already defined, but incorrectly point to IPC calls, which are listed at the top of this message.\n\n\n\n'","timestamp":1761140056720}]}
