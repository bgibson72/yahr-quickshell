║          FASTFETCH IMAGES - TERMINAL COMPATIBILITY               ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

✅ CHAFA IS INSTALLED AND WORKING!

⚠  CURRENT TERMINAL: VS Code/Codium (xterm-256color)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHY IMAGES DON'T SHOW IN VSCODE:

VSCode's integrated terminal has limited support for advanced terminal
graphics protocols like chafa. The images ARE being processed correctly,
but VSCode can't display them.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✨ SOLUTION - Use a Real Terminal:

Open Kitty (which you have installed) and run:

    ~/.config/fastfetch/run-fastfetch.sh

Or simply:

    fastfetch --chafa ~/.config/fastfetch/images/Eldritch/Eldritch.png --logo-width 40

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

TERMINALS THAT SUPPORT IMAGES:

✅ Kitty (recommended - you have this!)
✅ WezTerm
✅ iTerm2 (macOS)
✅ Alacritty (with chafa)
✅ foot
✅ konsole

❌ VSCode/Codium integrated terminal
❌ Basic xterm
❌ Most IDE integrated terminals

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

TESTING:

1. Open Kitty terminal:
   $ kitty

2. Run the wrapper script:
   $ ~/.config/fastfetch/run-fastfetch.sh

3. You should see your Eldritch image! 🎨

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ALIAS FOR SHELL STARTUP:

Add to ~/.zshrc to run fastfetch on terminal startup:

# Only run with images in real terminals, not in VSCode
if [[ "$TERM" != "xterm-256color" ]] || [[ -z "$VSCODE_PID" ]]; then
    ~/.config/fastfetch/run-fastfetch.sh
else
    # Fallback to regular fastfetch in VSCode
    fastfetch
fi

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Current Status:
✅ Chafa installed
✅ Scripts working
✅ Eldritch image ready
✅ Theme detection working
⚠  Need to test in Kitty terminal to see images

Run in Kitty to see your theme image!
