There is also no file picker button if the user wants to pick their desired save to disk location from their files.\n\nOn the themes page, it looks like there is a layout issue and the color chips and names are all jumbled together.'","timestamp":1761236560285},{"id":"Xwe8.qml","source":"Chat Edit: 'I might want to tweak those color chips another time, but that should do for now, thanks!
