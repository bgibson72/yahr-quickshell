The Arch Logo button should have an actual button appearance with the button background using the accent color and the arch logo should match the bar background color.\n\n2. The clock is not centered on the bar.\n\n3. The power button should also appear as a button using an accent color from the thtme color palette. Themes are located in ~/.config/hypr/themes/ and the script that sets the theme is ~/.config/hypr/theme-switcher.conf.\n\n4. The workspace numbers should be the size font used by the clock, and vice versa. The updater on the right side of the bar should also use the same size font as the clock.\n\nDoes the new quickshell bar use the color themes that my waybar setup uses? If not, it should be implemented.\n\n'","timestamp":1760462155506},{"id":"oll1.sh","source":"Chat Edit: 'Can we add Zed to the applications that are themed with the theme-switcher script?'","timestamp":1761576319337},{"id":"Ot25.sh","timestamp":1761663660095},{"id":"eNCW.sh","source":"Chat Edit: 'Yes, I would like this to be an automated process--when the theme is changed through quickshell, other apps not themed by gtk should have a script that auto changes the UI using whatever method is necessary.'","timestamp":1761679683211},{"id":"Cg6S.sh","source":"Chat Edit: 'Yes, I would like this to be an automated process--when the theme is changed through quickshell, other apps not themed by gtk should have a script that auto changes the UI using whatever method is necessary.'","timestamp":1761679724956},{"id":"8AXe.sh","source":"Chat Edit: 'We should also remove Zed since I never got that to work, and don't care to.
